<p>The following is a list of boards that have received <b>no Board Owner login for two weeks</b>. Because this list is automated, it does <b>not</b> include boards whose Board Owners have failed to comply with <a href="/globalrule.html" target="_blank">The {{ config.chan_name }} Global Rule</a> or <b>any</b> of the <a href="/faq.html#help-the-owner-of-x-board-is-doing-something-i-dont-like-remove-him" target="_blank">conditions for legitimate board ownership</a>.</p>

<p>The boards contained in this list are considered abandoned and anyone can claim them. <b>To claim a board, please email {{ config.chan_claim_email }}.</b> If applicable, include any relevant experience with the board's subject matter as well. Most boards will be given away on a first-come-first-serve basis, but large boards with long histories may require multiple applications from many different individuals before a decision is made, <i>at the discretion of the {{ config.chan_name }} administration</i>.</p>

<p>Please note: this page is regenerated every hour.</p>
<p>Replies to claim emails may require some time, depending on the board in question. Invalid claims may not even receive a reply (for instance, if the Board Owner is quite active and complies with The {{ config.chan_name }} Global Rule and the conditions for legitimate board ownership). <b>If you wish to create a new board immediately and you are not overly concerned with the board's name, please go through the <a href="/create.php" target="_blank">automatic board creation process</a> instead.</b> Thank you for using {{ config.chan_name }}, anon!</p>
